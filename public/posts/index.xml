Now if you are in any way involved with the cloud native ecosystem, you will probably have come across it. After all, it shares its name with a Greek Titan that starred in one of the world famous &amp;lsquo;Alien&amp;rsquo; movies üëΩ. But then I tell you that it is a monitoring and alerting toolkit that includes data scraping and storing, it&amp;rsquo;s own querying language called &amp;lsquo;PromQL&amp;rsquo; and a built in alert manager.</description></item><item><title>Antrea: Giving My Pods A Voice</title><link>https://whattheheptio.com/2020/02/03-antrea/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2020 19:16:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whattheheptio.com/2020/02/03-antrea/</guid><description>Hello World! Welcome back üéâ What a week (or two) it has been, full of yet more WTH moments. While there are many different cloud-native platforms, tools and services that I could centre this latest instalment around this week; I thought I‚Äôd take the opportunity to discuss an interesting project that I came across in my day to day life.

That&amp;rsquo;s not to mean that by the end of reading you won&amp;rsquo;t have learned anything new. hopefully you will find it inciteful, and maybe even helpful for your own learning and exploration into the field of cloud native platforms. Believe me; The articles that sit on this blog are only where the work really begins.</description></item><item><title>Lets direct our Kubernetes traffic with... Contour? üö¶</title><link>https://whattheheptio.com/2020/02/first-posts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2020 10:43:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whattheheptio.com/2020/02/first-posts/</guid><description>So you understand the premise of a container, pretty cool right? You have one way or another been taken through a rundown of how Kubernetes can help harness these nifty little containers, and enable enterprises to run their services with a whole new level of control and efficiency. Now you feel accomplished in your understanding of this new trend, and someone has burst your bubble by uttering a sentence like, &amp;ldquo;I use Contour as my ingress controller; it deploys Envoy as the reverse proxy and load balancer, what do you use?</description></item></channel></rss>
