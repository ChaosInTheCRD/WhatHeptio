Welcome back 🎉 What a week it has been, full of yet more WTH moments. While there are many different cloud-native platforms, tools and services that I could centre this latest instalment around this week; I thought I’d take the opportunity to discuss an interesting project that I came across on my travels.

Believe me; The articles that sit on this blog are only where the work really begins.</description></item><item><title>Lets direct our Kubernetes traffic with...

You have one way or another been taken through a rundown of how Kubernetes can help harness these nifty little containers, and enable enterprises to run their services with a whole new level of control and efficiency. Now you feel accomplished in your understanding of this new trend, and someone has burst your bubble by uttering a sentence like, &amp;ldquo;I use Contour as my ingress controller; it deploys Envoy as the reverse proxy and load balancer, what do you use?</description></item></channel></rss>
